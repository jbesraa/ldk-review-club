2. Did you read the [BOLT2/quiescence](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#channel-quiescence) to learn more about the Quiescence protocol?
3. In what part of the lightning network protocol is the channel quiescence used or will be used?
4. If we are in the middle of a quiescence protocol exchange, and the connection sadly drops, what happens?
5. How is [ldk/3588] implementing the protocol? How will it track the channel state?
6. What happens to channel updates after a channel is in quiescence mode? How is [ldk/3588] implementing it?
