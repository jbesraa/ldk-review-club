## Notes
  This is part two of the review for [bLIP/31] named "Mutual Message Exchange".  In the first
  session we reviewed the [bLIP/31] definition, and in this part we will cover the implementation at
  [ldk/2829].

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
2. In `mutual-message-exchange/src/lib.rs` we have three public functions, `respond_with_message`, `decode_message`, and `get_init_bytes`. What are the main purposes of these functions?
3. What is the purpose of `get_idx_permutation` `get_cover_trusted_count` functions?
4. What do we save in the `TrustedSet` struct and why?
5. What is `variable_time_decryption` and how is it used in the code?
