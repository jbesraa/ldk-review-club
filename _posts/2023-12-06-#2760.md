## Notes
  Creating a channel involves exchanging multiple messages with a
  connected peer, which does not always end up successfully.
  Specifically, in the current implementation an infinite loop might occur 
  in the funding step.
  This bug was resulted from [ldk/2077].

  [ldk/2760] Addresses this bug.

* Channel establishment(v1) is the process of creating a channel with a
  connected peer, as detailed here [lightning/bolt02].

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
2. In the original code we have a loop inside `close_channel_internal`, 
in which scenario it goes indefintly? 
3. Why are we able to drop `force_close_channel_with_peer` from
`close_channel_internal`, and `funding_created` msg from `SignerResumeUpdate`?
4. What was the reasoning for promoting an `OutboundV1Channel` to a 
`Channel` before receiving `funding_signed` prior to this PR? Why 
do we no only do that promotion after receiving `funding_signed`?
