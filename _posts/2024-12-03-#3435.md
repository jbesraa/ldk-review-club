## Notes

## Questions

1. Did you review [ldk/3435]? Is it a [Concept ACK, Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK?](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
2. What problem is this patch solving? Can you provide a user story?
3. What is the concept behind the HMAC in LDK? See the [online definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC#:~:text=In%20cryptography%2C%20an%20HMAC%20(sometimes,and%20a%20secret%20cryptographic%20key.)
4. In commit [7cdcd](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/3435/commits/7cdcd705e0713716835c3d696eadf6e2e32604e6), why is the struct `ExpandedKey` used?
5. Does LDK authenticate a keysend payment? If yes, what is the commit that proves it is true?
6. When is the `payment_context` `Some`? Is it specified when just routing an HTLC and the LDK node is just a middle hop in the path? If yes, why?
