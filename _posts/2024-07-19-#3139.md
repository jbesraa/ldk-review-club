## Notes

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
2. Why do we need an authentication method in BOLT12, specifically during the invoice request?
3. Is the authentication algorithm specified inside the BOLT12 proposal, or is
   it used for an LDK use case?
4. After this PR, will LDK be retrocompatible with previously generated offers?
