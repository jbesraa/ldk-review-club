## Notes
`splice_locked` is part of the [SPLICE COMPLETION] step in the splicing process. The `splice_locked`
message indicates that the splice is completed and the channel can use the new funding transaction.


## Questions

1. Have you reviewed [ldk/3741]? If so, is it a [Concept ACK, Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK?](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
2. When are `splice_locked` messages exchanged?
3. How is the exchange of `splice_locked` messages tracked?
4. What happens to a channel's `FundingScope` after `splice_locked` messages are exchanged?
5. Why is the signature (return value) of `do_chain_event` changed?
6. Why is `fn should_emit_channel_ready_event` name changed to `fn should_emit_initial_channel_ready_event`?
7. After this PR, LDK will potentially emit `ChannelReady` event for the same channel more than
   once. What is the reason for this change? How can we distinguish between the different events?
