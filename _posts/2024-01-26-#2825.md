## Notes
  Bitcoin wallet outputs are the set of UTXOs the wallet can control and sign.
  In Lightning, we use the outputs during the initialization of
  channels or in other times around closing channels.
  [ldk/2825] introduces a new module in order to help with
  managing the outputs in Lightning environment.
