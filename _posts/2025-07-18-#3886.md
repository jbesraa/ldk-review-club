## Notes

[Splicing] is a process that allows users to change the funding transaction of a channel without closing it. This pull request adds further required changes, building on previous updates covered in the last two RC sessions. More specifically, this pull request amends the `channel_reestablish` flow (among other changes) to make it compatible with splicing.
