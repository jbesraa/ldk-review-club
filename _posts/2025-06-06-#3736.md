## Notes
[Splicing] is a process that allows users to change the funding transaction of a channel without
closing it. This PR introduces the concept of "Transaction Negotiation" for splicing, which is a way
to construct transactions interactively between peers using [INTERACTIVE TRANSACTION CONSTRUCTION].


## Questions

1. Have you reviewed [ldk/3736]? If so, is it a [Concept ACK, Approach ACK, Tested ACK, or NACK?](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)
2. Define "Transaction Negotiation" in the context of splicing. What is its purpose and how it
   differs from regular "Interactive Transaction Construction"?
3. When does "Transaction Negotiation" start and when does it end? What are the key steps
   involved?
4. [ldk/3736] introduces `FundedChannel::as_renegotiating_channel` and `PendingV2Channel::as_negotiating_channel` methods. What is the purpose of these methods, and how do they relate to the transaction negotiation process?
5. How is a splice tracked in `FundedChannel` throughout its lifetime? 
6. Bonus: What are the differences and similarities between [Dual Funding] and [Splicing]?
